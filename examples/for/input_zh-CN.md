The `for in` construct can be used to iterate an `Iterator`, a lazy value
generator (more details later). One of the most common iterators is the `range`
function. `range(a, b)` will yield values from `a` (inclusive) to `b`
(exclusive) in steps of one.

Let's write fizzbuzz using `for` instead of `while`.
