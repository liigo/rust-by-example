Rust provides Higher Order Functions (HOF), these are functions that take a
closure as argument to produce a more useful function. HOFs and lazy iterators
give Rust its functional flavor.

{hof.play}

[Option](http://doc.rust-lang.org/core/option/type.Option.html)
and
[Iterator](http://doc.rust-lang.org/core/iter/trait.Iterator.html)
implement their fair share of HOFs.
